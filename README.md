### Overview
This is you second assignment for familiarising yourself with PyTorch.

In this repo you will find the solution to your first assignment.
I suggest that you study the code carefully and take notice
of the things that you did differently.
The primary goal of this assignment is to implement a simple
self-attention mechanism.

You will find the reference implementation in this paper:
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S17-2126.


I will write an in depth readme soon.
